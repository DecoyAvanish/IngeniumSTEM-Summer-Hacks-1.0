      <h1>Banks are in the money-lending business.</h1>
      <p>To lend money, they need evidence of security and stability. It's that simple. How can you provide this evidence when your business hasn't even gotten off the ground?</p>
      <p>Begin by ensuring your loan application is both realistic and optimistic. If you predict an increase in sales of between 8 and 12 percent, explain how you can reach out to your market and generate enough sales to achieve those numbers. Make sure you have all angles covered: know your expenses, costs of doing business, your pricing, and how many products you expect to sell or hours of service you can provide in a day, a week, a month, and a year. Be realistic and triple-check your math.</p>

      <h2>How to Ensure Your Loan Application is Complete</h2>
      <p>Also, ensure your application is complete. When a piece of an application is missing, bankers instantly suspect that either something is being hidden or the applicant doesn't know their business well enough to compile the information. Underwriting rules aren't as flexible as they used to be, either.</p>
      <p>There are 12 separate items that should be included in every loan application:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="list-item">Cover sheet: This is the title page to your "book." All it needs to say is "Loan application submitted by John Smith, Sunday's Ice Cream Parlor, to Big Bucks Bank, Main Street, Anytown." It should also include the date and your business telephone number.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Cover letter: The cover letter is a personal business letter to your banker requesting consideration of your application for a line of credit or an installment loan. The second paragraph should describe your business: "Our company is a [sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation] in manufacturing, distributing, and retailing X type of goods." The third paragraph should succinctly "sell" your application by indicating your plans for your business.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Table of contents: This simple page makes it easy for your banker to verify that all required documents are included.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Amount and use of the loan: This page documents how much you want to borrow and how you will use the loan. If you are buying new equipment, for instance, show the contract price, add the cost of freight and installation, deduct your contribution, and show the balance to be borrowed. Explain why this equipment is crucial for your business.</li>
        <li class="list-item">History and description of your business: This is often the most challenging section to write. Stick to the facts and assume the reader knows nothing about your business. Describe your business's legal form and location. Explain why you believe your business will succeed. Conclude with your future plans and predictions, especially if your business has not yet started.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Management team: People make things happen. Your management team might include every employee if they play a crucial role in your operation, or it might be just you and one key person. Include any outside consultants you plan to use regularly, such as your accountant or banker. List each person's name and responsibilities in one or two pages. Provide background information demonstrating why each person is the right choice for their role. Ensure your own background is included, highlighting anything that indicates you are a good risk.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Market information: Begin with a comprehensive description of your product line or service and the target market. Describe how you have targeted your market niche and your current success. Detail your plans to introduce new products or services.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Financial history: Most bankers want to see balance sheets and income (profit and loss) statements. As a startup, use projections. Bankers will compare these to industry norms.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Financial projections: Provide a projected income statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement. Show how your business, with the loan, will generate sufficient profits to repay the loan. Your accountant can assist in preparing these documents.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Collateral: List available collateral—cash reserves, stocks and bonds, equipment, home equity, inventory, and receivables—to demonstrate your understanding of backup repayment sources. Describe each piece of collateral, including its cost and current fair market value. Be ready to provide documentation of value, such as appraisals or paperwork.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Personal financial statements: As a startup, add your personal guarantee to any loan. Provide tax returns for several years and balance sheets showing personal net worth. Most banks provide preprinted forms to simplify this process.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Additional documents: Include any documents you believe will enhance your loan package, such as a sales contract for new equipment, a lease and photograph of a new location, blueprints, or legal documents. If introducing a new product or service, include a product brochure and additional market research information.</li>
